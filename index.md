## About
Contemporary algorithms and tools for time series management predominantly handle univariate time series. However, modern data sources frequently generate richer, multivariate time series. Examples include modern sensors that monitor multiple variables simultaneously (e.g., temperature, wind, and rainfall), finance time series (bid and ask price, along with volume), and data from specialized scientific and medical apparatus.
Despite the necessity, currently only very few algorithms address the management, analysis, and extraction of insights from such multivariate data. 
Moreover, existing work is tailored to specific needs. 
Foundational functionalities that have propelled advancements in univariate time series analysis, such as indexing for similarity search and detection of motifs, cannot be trivially extended to the multivariate case. 
This limitation significantly restricts the efficiency and/or effectiveness of existing efforts for the analysis of multivariate time series, for several analysis tasks. 

This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners working with multivariate time series, for presenting and discussing requirements, open problems, and related work, and to foster collaborations and further developments in the topic. Industry will participate for presenting problems, requirements, and current approaches, and to reach out to the ICDE community. Researchers will present their novel and ongoing  work on the topic. The full-day workshop will include: 
(a) 8 paper presentations (short papers and demos up to 4 pages, long papers up to 12 pages), 
(b) four invited talks from industry experts and domain experts, 
(c) panel discussion, and time for exchanging ideas and for fostering collaborations. The accepted papers and abstracts of the keynote and invited talks will be included in the ICDEW proceedings.

## Submission Guidelines
The workshop will accept both regular papers and short papers (work in progress, vision/outrageous ideas). All submissions must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE template available [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
